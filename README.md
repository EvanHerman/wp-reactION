# wp-reactION
Angular.js &amp; React.js powered WordPress theme

This project was forked from a project by [Roy Sivan](https://github.com/royboy789/angular-react-wordpress-theme) but contained a few outdated gulp dependencies and implemented an outdated version of the WP-API.

I originally forked this theme to learn more about integrating angular.js & react.js into a WordPress theme.

Without the initial repo from [Roy Sivan](https://github.com/royboy789/angular-react-wordpress-theme), this theme most likely would not have come to fruition.
